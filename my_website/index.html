    <p style="font-size:160%;">My name is Casey Williams. I have had an amazing time learning new things in my Computer Science class. This class in particular is one of my favorite classes this year. My favorite thing in anime history would have to be Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z. But given the name and picture of this website, you probably new that already.</p>
